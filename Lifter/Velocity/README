These templates are used to generate the auto-lifter files.
They use loops to automate the process of generating typeclass instances used when searching for liftings.
The easiest way to use these is to install the "templates" plugin in Isabelle-Jedit.
Isabelle-jedit tries to look for templates (by default) in $HOME/.isabelle/Isabelle2021/jedit/templates
